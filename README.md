# :books:Tsundoku
My own version of the library project of The Odin Project. 

Since I've been learning Japanese through an immersion-based methodology, I thought creating this site would be the perfect opportunity to make an app that could track my reading material. 

To accomplish this I integrated the Jikan API to autofill the form that asks you the total amount of chapters and an image to display.

Also, I included localStorage so the items wouldn't dissapear once you refresh the page.
